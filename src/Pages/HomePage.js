              Welcome to our website, where you can find comprehensive data on
              bike-share trips in the Helsinki and Espoo area for the month of
              May 2021. Our app provides a range of statistics on user trips,
              such as station addresses, capacity, number of pick-ups and
              drop-offs, and average distance between stations. Our easy-to-use
              table format allows you to easily compare statistics from
              different stations. We have also included a map showing the
              location of each station, so you can see the bike stations in
              their geographic context. Our aim is to provide an easy-to-use
              interface that allows you to access and explore the data
              effortlessly.
